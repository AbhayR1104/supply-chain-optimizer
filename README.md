Supply Chain Optimizer ðŸ©ºðŸšš
Overview
This project is an interactive web application designed to solve complex vehicle routing problems (VRP) for urban logistics. Using real-world taxi trip data from NYC as a proxy for customer locations, this tool simulates a medical supply distribution network and uses Google's OR-Tools to find the most efficient delivery routes.

The final product is a Dash web application that allows a user to set parameters like fleet size and vehicle capacity, run the optimization, and visualize the optimized routes on an interactive map of New York City. The application also includes a "non-optimized" greedy algorithm to provide a clear benchmark and demonstrate the significant efficiency gains from the OR-Tools solver.

Key Features
Realistic Data Simulation: Leverages millions of real NYC taxi trip records to create a geographically accurate distribution of customer demand points.

Powerful Optimization Engine: Implements Google's OR-Tools to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), minimizing total distance while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.

Comparative Analysis: Includes a "non-optimized" greedy solver to provide a direct, visual comparison against the sophisticated OR-Tools solution, quantifying the value of optimization.

Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly dashboard built with Dash and Plotly allows for easy control of simulation parameters and clear visualization of results.

Robust and Efficient: The application is structured to run efficiently by using a consistent, pre-sampled set of orders for fair comparisons.

Future Improvements
This project serves as a powerful foundation. Future enhancements could include:

Real-World Routing: Integrating a routing engine like OSRM or the Google Maps API to use actual road network distances and visualize turn-by-turn routes instead of straight lines.

Advanced Constraints: Adding complexity to the model, such as delivery time windows, driver shifts, or multi-depot starting points.

Live Deployment: Finalizing the deployment on a service like Render by pre-processing the data to overcome memory limitations.
